# Detection and Grading of Macula Edema using Convolutional Neural Network 

The macula is an oval-shaped area close to the middle of the human retina. This area contains massive concentrations of cone cells and is responsible for sharp, colored vision. Macular edema (ME), one of the most common types of macular disorder, which is caused by fluid accumulation beneath the macula. In this paper, we present an automated system for the detection of Macula edema from fundus images. We introduce a new automated system for the detailed grading of the severity of disease using the knowledge of exudates and maculae. A new set of features is used on with a minimum distance classifier for accurate localization of the fovea, which is important for the grading of ME . The proposed system uses different hybrid features  for segmentation of exudates. The proposed algorithm is validated using public and local datasets.
